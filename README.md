# Heat-Exchanger-Simulation

This program calculates the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference(LMTD) of a heat exchanger. 

#Input
It allows users to input parameters such as the hot fluid inlet and outlet temperatures, cold fluid inlet and outlet temperatures.

#output
The program will output the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference(LMTD) of a heat exchanger in degrees Celsius.
